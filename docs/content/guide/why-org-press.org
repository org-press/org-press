#+TITLE: Why Org-Press?
#+DESCRIPTION: The case for org-mode as a documentation format

* Why Org-Press?

There are many static site generators. Here's why org-press might be right for you.

** The Problem with Documentation

Most documentation tools share these issues:

1. *Code examples rot* - Copy-pasted output becomes stale
2. *No code reuse* - Same snippet duplicated across files
3. *Separate test suites* - Examples and tests are disconnected
4. *Limited metadata* - Markdown requires extensions for basics

Org-press solves these by making documentation executable and composable.

** Executable Examples

In traditional documentation, you write code and manually copy the output:

#+begin_src markdown
```javascript
const sum = [1, 2, 3].reduce((a, b) => a + b);
// Output: 6
```
#+end_src

The problem? That =// Output: 6= was typed by a human. It might be wrong. It might become wrong after refactoring.

In org-press, the code runs:

#+begin_export html
<pre><code>#+begin_src javascript :use preview | withSourceCode
const sum = [1, 2, 3].reduce((a, b) => a + b);
sum;
#+end_src</code></pre>
#+end_export

The output is always current. Always correct.

** Code Reuse Across Files

Markdown doesn't support importing code between files. You either duplicate code or maintain external files.

Org-press supports cross-file imports:

#+begin_export html
<pre><code>// In validation.org
#+NAME: validators
#+begin_src typescript
export function isEmail(s: string): boolean {
  return /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(s);
}
#+end_src

// In api.org - use the same validators
import { isEmail } from './validation.org?name=validators';
</code></pre>
#+end_export

One source of truth. No copy-paste drift.

** Comparisons

*** vs Markdown-Based Tools (VitePress, Docusaurus)

| Feature | Markdown SSG | Org-Press |
|---------+--------------+-----------|
| Code execution | Plugin/extension | Built-in |
| Block naming | Not standard | Native (=#+NAME:=) |
| Block parameters | Custom syntax | Standard (=:use=, =:tangle=) |
| Cross-file imports | Not supported | Native |
| IDE support | Varies | Full TypeScript |

*When to use Markdown*: If your team already knows Markdown well and you don't need executable code.

*When to use Org-Press*: If you want literate programming features without inventing custom syntax.

*** vs Jupyter Notebooks

| Feature | Jupyter | Org-Press |
|---------+---------+-----------|
| Format | JSON | Plain text |
| Version control | Messy diffs | Clean diffs |
| Editor | Browser-based | Any editor |
| Tooling | Jupyter-specific | Standard (ESLint, Prettier) |
| Output | Inline cells | Web pages |

*When to use Jupyter*: Data science exploration with inline visualizations.

*When to use Org-Press*: Documentation websites, technical writing, literate libraries.

*** vs Emacs Org-Mode + Hugo/Jekyll

| Feature | Org + Hugo | Org-Press |
|---------+------------+-----------|
| Emacs required | Yes (for execution) | No |
| Code execution | Via Babel | Native browser/Node |
| HMR | No | Yes |
| React/TSX | Complex setup | Built-in |
| TypeScript | Manual config | First-class |

*When to use Org + Hugo*: If you're already in the Emacs ecosystem and want static HTML.

*When to use Org-Press*: Modern web DX with Vite, HMR, and React without Emacs.

*** vs Observable/Quarto

| Feature | Observable | Org-Press |
|---------+------------+-----------|
| Format | Custom cells | Standard org |
| Hosting | Observable.com | Any static host |
| Language | JavaScript | JS/TS/TSX + plugins |
| Privacy | Cloud-based | Self-hosted |

*When to use Observable*: Data visualization with collaborative editing.

*When to use Org-Press*: Self-hosted documentation with full control.

** The Org-Mode Advantage

Org-mode has decades of design refinement for literate programming:

*** Native Block Naming

#+begin_export html
<pre><code>#+NAME: calculateTax
#+begin_src typescript
export function calculateTax(amount: number, rate: number): number {
  return amount * rate;
}
#+end_src</code></pre>
#+end_export

No custom syntax needed. It's part of the format.

*** Standard Parameters

#+begin_export html
<pre><code>#+begin_src typescript :use server
// Block behavior controlled by standard parameters
#+end_src</code></pre>
#+end_export

Parameters like =:use=, =:tangle= control block behavior.

*** Hierarchical Structure

Org's outline structure (=*=, =**=, =***=) creates natural document hierarchy without relying on heading syntax.

** When to Choose Org-Press

*Choose org-press if you want:*

- Documentation where examples actually run
- Code that can be imported across files
- Standard tooling (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- Modern web development experience (Vite, HMR)
- Plain text files that work with any editor

*Consider alternatives if you:*

- Need team familiarity with Markdown (use VitePress)
- Do interactive data exploration (use Jupyter)
- Want Observable's collaborative features (use Observable)
- Are fully embedded in Emacs (use Org + Hugo)
